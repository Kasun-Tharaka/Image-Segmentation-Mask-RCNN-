first create env python=3.7
activate and install labelme - pip install labelme.

here we are doing segmentation using Detectron2. doing annotation only one file will be created called json, it will be 
convered into coco format. bcz Detectron2 accept only COCO format.

after annotation(labelme formated), that has to be converted into COCO for that run in terminal 
labelme2coco.py (with anotated folder name)   - labelme2coco.py label_mask

it will be created trainval.json file

after create that, you have to keep only that genarated file and only image folder(without annotated json files)

chech the data folder.
